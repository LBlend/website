    <p>I am a <span id="age">?</span> year old software dev from Norway.</p>
    <p>
      Welcome to my website! Where I happily share too much information about myself to get that sweet narcissistic fix.
    </p>
    <p>
      I love making stuff, be it software, media or food. Though as for food I prefer eating it :)
      <br />
      There's always something new to explore, experience and learn. Join me in trying to balance way too many passions with
      way too little time.
    </p>
    <p>
      Currently based in Oslo, Norway{" "}
      <Image src={norway} width={26} height={26} alt="Flag of Norway" class="inline saturate-70" />

      Though I'm hoping that will change in the future.
