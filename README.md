My personal website. As of writing it features a blog, microblog (twitter clone) and miscellaneous info about me.

The site is based on the blog template provided by AstroJS. You can do so yourself by running the command below:

```sh
npm create astro@latest -- --template blog
```

## ðŸ§ž Commands

All commands are run from the root of the project, from a terminal:

The website's design is basically a copy-cat version of [Xetera's website](https://github.com/Xetera/xetera.dev), as well as [Jax Tam's](https://github.com/EnhancedJax/jaxtam.dev). Let's just say creativity is not my top trait :)
